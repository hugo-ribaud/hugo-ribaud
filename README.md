# Hugo Ribaud — Full-Stack Developer

> I build web and mobile apps that replace spreadsheets, paper processes, 
> and duct-taped tools — for companies that are done improvising.

## What I ship

- **Web apps** (Next.js + Supabase) — from MVP to production-grade
- **Mobile apps** (React Native / Expo) — iOS + Android, single codebase
- **Admin dashboards & back-offices** — so your team can manage without calling IT

## Recent work

Built a cross-platform mobile app + custom CMS for an international facilities 
management company — deployed across **10 sites, 5,000+ active users**, 
solo dev from scratch to production in 9 months.
